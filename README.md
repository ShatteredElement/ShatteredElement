- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ShatteredElement
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things security, but have a huge interest in digital forensics, malware analysis, and exploit development and mitigation.  I'm still fairly new to the field, but looking to gain experience and do more making/breaking of things.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about DFIR processes and tools, and am trying to get more tools and languages under my belt.  If anyone has any interesting POCs they want to talk about, or would like to collab on anything, feel free to send me a message!
- I'm still building out some things at present, but will hopefully deploy some finished products and post some guides in the not too distant future!
